# house_price_prediction
## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning regression model that accurately predicts house prices in India based on important home features such as living area after renovation, area excluding basement, number of bedrooms, house grade, and postal code.

The project aims to demonstrate the complete ML pipeline, including exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretation through feature importance, to provide reliable price estimates usable for real estate investment and decision-making.

## Project Conclusion

This project successfully developed a robust Random Forest regression model achieving a mean absolute error of approximately â‚¹108,000 and explaining about 73% of the price variability. Feature importance analysis confirmed that house grade and usable area substantially drive price prediction.

Future enhancements include developing user-friendly deployment interfaces, exploring additional data features, and experimenting with more advanced modeling techniques. This end-to-end project sets a strong foundation for practical real estate value prediction applications.
